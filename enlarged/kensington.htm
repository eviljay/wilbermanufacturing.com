There was a time when fences were considered a restriction . . . a wall of sorts. Country Estate's many privacy and residential fence designs are changing that perception. Kensington's trim efficiency will add beauty and value to your property while allowing air flow. Your neighbors will recognize it as a strikingly beautiful addition to the neighborhood and it will never become an eye-sore begging for paint. The boards won't peel or blister, the nails won't rust, and the posts won't rot off. Country Estate Fence replaces those problems with ultra-violet resisters and impact modifiers that assure strength and beauty.
