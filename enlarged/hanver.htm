Now the traditional "stockade" fence is available from Country Estate. This unique style provides privacy and air-flow. It works well as a screen for unsightly areas, and regardless of its age, The Denver style fence never needs painting. Of course, that also means it never needs scraping, and the finish will never peel or blister like painted wood. You can enjoy Denver with wide verticals or integrate a narrower Hannibal vertical between each Denver panel (we call it Hanver). The Hannibal and Denver caps are designed with identical bevels, so they look great together.
