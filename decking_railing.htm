    Country Estate Polyvinyl Decking is beautiful, durable and priced competitive with redwood. It eliminates chemical cleaning and preservation treatments. And this vinyl decking doesn't squeak when you walk on it. Country Estate Decking is made from 100% virgin PVC. The color is uniform throughout our solid wall extrusion, so it never shows a second color when scratched or marred like co-extruded polyvinyl. Without the need for waterproofing with sealants or chemicals, Country Estate Decking is a safe play surface for children and pets. Available in white, almond, and gray. </td>

    When properly installed, Country Estate porch, deck, and balcony railings are safe and secure. As with all Country Estate Products, our Handrailing is made from 100% virgin polyvinyl, and then reinforced with a system of aluminum and wood inner supports. </td>
