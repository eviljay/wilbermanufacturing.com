Everybody loves the traditional American picket fence and Country Estate's Georgetown is the most durable and trouble-free picket fence ever. It is meticulously constructed of virgin polyvinyl chloride extrusions that never need painting. They simply shrug off chipping, cracking and rotting problems so common to wood construction. The finest improvement to picket fences came hundreds of years after the fence was originated . . . it's Country Estate's Georgetown. The Nantucket has all the same great dimensions and the pickets are twice as wide.
