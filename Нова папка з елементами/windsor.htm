Gain the total privacy you desire in a modern ranch-style fence design. We call it Windsor - many refer to it as "basketweave". Regardless what you call it, this product is free from traditional maintenance. Country Estate Fence features PVC construction entirely with virgin compounds, impervious to moisture and freezing temperatures, and it won't peel, blister or rot. Forget painting, it's never needed with Country Estate Fence. When you select our product, you've eliminated the traditional maintenance found with wood, metal or imitation polyvinyl fence.
