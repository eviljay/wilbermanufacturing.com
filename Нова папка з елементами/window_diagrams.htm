<p><b>Points to Remember</b>    </p>
<ol>
  <li>  For accuracy, measure each width dimension twice, once near the top of the window and then again at the bottom.  Additionally, measure each height dimension twice, once from the left-hand side of the window and then again at the right-hand side of the window.  If there is a difference, please record the smallest measurement.  <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Please remember to always refer to the Width measurement first, followed by the Height.  Example:  a 28" x 36" measurement will mean 28" Wide (w) by 36" High (H). </li>

  <td valign="top" colspan="2"><b><i><u>Two-Light Window</u></i></b>
<br>
<br>
Based on our experience, this type of window is the most common.  The two-light is a window where both the top and the bottom sash are the same width and height.  The left and right jambs are an equal distance from side to side, and the meeting rail is an equal distance from top to bottom.
<br><br> 
There are other types of windows, such as an Oriel (the top sash height is smaller than the bottom sash height), or a Reverse Oriel (the bottom sash height is smaller than the top sash height).  
<br><br> 
<b><i>Please contact us if your window is different than the Two-Light Window and we will walk you through the measurements.</i></b>
<br><br> 
<b><i><u>Horizontal Sliding Window</u></i></b>
<br><br>
Either one or both sashes will slide from side to side.  Always indicate which way the window panel moves as viewed from the outside of the window.  We refer to the operating sash as the "X" sash, and we refer to the non-operating sash as the "O" sash.
<br><br>
<b><i>Special Note:</i></b>
<br><br>
Your measurements are important.  Because Wilber Manufacturing Co. custom products are made to your specifications, they are not returnable for any reason other than defective material(s) outside of normal wear-and-tear.
