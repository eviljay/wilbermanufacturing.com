The Europeans use lattice throughout their homes, yards and flower gardens because it provides a beautiful setting for flowers and greenery. Durable PVC lattice by Country Estate is one of the most creative tools you can find today. These traditional lattice panels, constructed of scientifically formulated 100% virgin PVC compounds, never need painting. Maintenance? It's reduced to an absolute minimum - no flaking, blistering or rotting, and that's important since nearly all lattice touches the soil or plants at some point. We've combined the beauty of lattice with the impressive durability of PVC for a product with nearly unlimited design capabilities. Bring that Mediterranean feeling to your own yard today. . . with Country Estate Dura-Lattice.
