The Lakeland provides a solid privacy wall that features tongue-and-groove verticals for greater fence strength. Some Country Estate customers prefer Lakeland as pictured here . . . but others add a decorative eye-level layer of lattice. Lakeland is one of our newer residential fence styles and has proven to be a solid choice among homeowners who want full privacy for their yard.

The Lakeland Concave is a unique variation featuring scalloped spans while providing true privacy. The Lakeland Convex features arched sections with the privacy you've come to expect from Lakeland.
