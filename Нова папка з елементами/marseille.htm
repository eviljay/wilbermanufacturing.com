The Europeans love lattice because it compliments a garden so well. The purity of white fence with a dash of lattice is not only beautiful when it's new, but unlike traditional fence after years of use, the Marseille doesn't need painting. You can enjoy the climbing ivy without having to tear it down to repaint. Country Estate Fence is constructed of the finest compounds of virgin polyvinyl chloride, a modern man-made substance that won't rot, chip, crack and it never yellows or requires painting. The Europeans were right. There's nothing like a touch of lattice.
