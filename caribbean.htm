The clean lines of Caribbean style fence are like a welcome sea breeze. Carefully spaced verticals let fresh air flow through without sacrificing the privacy you desire. Concerned about design? You'll find the sleek Caribbean style is complimentary to many of today's modern home styles. While your neighbors are scraping and painting their wood fence, you can lean back in your lawnchair and silently congratulate yourself for choosing Country Estate Fence, free from traditional maintenance.
