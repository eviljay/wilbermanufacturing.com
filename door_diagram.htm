    <p>Measure the full width at the top and bottom, from the inside edge of the casing to the opposite side, using the smallest dimension in the event there seems to be some variance in your measurement.  Then, measure the height from the top inside edge of the casing to the threshold, using the smallest dimension in the event there seems to be some variance in your measurement.      </p>

      <li>  Please let us know if you want your storm door hinged on the right or left-hand side (facing the door from the outside).  Based on our experience, the hinges should be on the same side as the main entry door.  There are, however, valuable reasons to have your storm door hinged on the opposite side of the main entry door.  Ultimately, what side your door is hinged on is based on which scenario will make you the most satisfied. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>  Please let us know where the door latch should be placed.  This is important so that the storm door latch doesn't interfere with the main entry door latch.  To get the correct measurement, please measure  the existing interior door latch from the bottom (threshold) to the center of the interior door latch.  Make sure you tell us what side the interior door latch is on (L) left or (R) right. </li>
